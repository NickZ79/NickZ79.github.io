# ✅ Project Requirements & How They Were Met

### **1. Create a website with at least 4 pages**  
The site includes a minimum of four fully structured HTML pages, all using the same navigation system and consistent styling.

---

### **2. Add a Modernizr script element**
Each HTML page includes:

```html
<script src="modernizr.custom.05819.js"></script>
```

This fulfills the modernizr requirement.

---

### **3. Add a JavaScript function that performs a mathematical calculation**  
Example functions include:

- A die-rolling function  
- A calculation function based on user input  
- Other page-specific JavaScript math operations  

This satisfies the Chapter 2 requirement.

### **4. Add content using decision statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)**  
Examples include:

- Showing different images depending on user selections  
- Returning different text based on form choices  
- Dynamically switching page output using condition logic  

This satisfies the Chapter 3 requirement.

---

### **5. Add form validation**  
The contact form includes:

- Required fields  
- Error messages  
- Condition checks  
- Prevention of submission until errors are fixed  

This fulfills the Chapter 6 requirement.
