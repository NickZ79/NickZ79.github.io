# 🍔 Midterm Project – Food Ordering System

The Midterm project is a JavaScript-based restaurant order form designed to calculate a meal’s subtotal, tip amount, and grand total based on user selections.

This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, condition checking, arithmetic operations, and dynamic updates to the interface.

## ✨ Features

### ✔ Select Menu Items  
The user checks the items they want to order.  
Each item has a predefined price provided by the instructor.

### ✔ Calculate Subtotal  
The program adds the prices of selected items and displays:  
**“Your order total is: $X.XX”**

### ✔ Tip Percentage Input  
The user enters a tip percentage (like 15 for 15%).

### ✔ Calculate Tip Amount  
JavaScript computes:

```
tipAmount = subtotal * (tipPercent / 100)
```

### ✔ Grand Total  
The system calculates:

```
grandTotal = subtotal + tipAmount
```

And displays it clearly in the summary area.
