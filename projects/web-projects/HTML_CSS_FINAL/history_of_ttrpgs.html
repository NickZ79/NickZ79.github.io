            <h2>The Dark Times: The Satanic Panic</h2>
            <p>The Satanic Panic was a period of widespread fear and moral hysteria in the United States during the 1980s and early 1990s, fueled by sensationalist media, evangelical rhetoric, and societal anxieties. It centered on the belief that Satanic cults were secretly infiltrating society, engaging in ritual abuse, and corrupting children through pop culture. Claims of "Satanic Ritual Abuse" (SRA), often unsubstantiated or outright false, gained traction through high-profile court cases and media coverage. Books like <em>Michelle Remembers</em> and talk shows amplified these fears, creating a moral crusade against perceived threats. This cultural phenomenon reflected deeper concerns about changing family dynamics, youth rebellion, and the rise of counterculture.</p>
            <p><em>Dungeons & Dragons (D&D)</em> became one of the key targets of the Satanic Panic, accused of promoting witchcraft, occultism, and devil worship among its players. As a game rich in fantasy elements like magic, demons, and mythical creatures, it was misinterpreted by critics as a tool for indoctrinating youth into Satanic practices. The death of teenager James Dallas Egbert III in 1979, erroneously linked to <em>D&D</em> by sensational media coverage, fueled this narrative. Evangelical figures like Patricia Pulling, founder of Bothered About Dungeons & Dragons (BADD), led campaigns to ban the game, claiming it caused psychological harm and even suicide. These accusations were baseless but had a chilling effect on players and the game's publishers, TSR. Despite the panic, <em>D&D</em> endured and the controversy ironically brought it greater visibility, eventually cementing its place in popular culture.</p>
